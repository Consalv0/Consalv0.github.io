# OGLApp <a href="https://github.com/Consalv0/OGLApp" class="btn right"> Repository </a>

> A **C++** engine prototype to learn how render pipelines work, model loading, fragment and vertex shader, shadow mapping, render textures, Microfacet Shaders, Toon Shaders, and bone animations using **OpenGL 3** to render the scene, **Lua** to modify the scenes in real time and **YAML** to parse scenes for initial launch.

# Map generator for a Game Jam

> Map generator using Perlin's noise with **Unity 3D**, the models are pieces made apart and used as bricks to build chunks, and because of the draw calls, the models are merged in a single one, as a fast approach to texturing the terrain I made a shader using the vertex normal direction to select the correspondent texture.

# FireBombs <a href="https://github.com/Consalv0/FireBombs" class="btn right"> Repository </a>

> Prototype made in 2017 for a game in **Unity 3D**, using skeletal animation with physics, the shaders have a gradient for the shading.
